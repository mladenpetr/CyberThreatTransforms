# FreeTransform

This is a bachelor project at Faculty of electrical engineering and computing (Zagreb).
The goal of this project is to implement Maltego transformations into Freeplane software 
in order to make mind mapping process easier.
To try these scripts, you will need Freeplane that can be downloaded for free at https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page.
This software automatically comes with groovy support so no additional downloads are required.
The scripts are placed into script
