This folder contains basic mind map examples that used scripts to form itself.
The scripts are already ran on some nodes, but feel free to experiment on same nodes as the results will append as child nodes.
Remember that not every script will run with every node. There are restrictions for every script parameters and if called incorrectly, 
the script will notify the user about the invalid script execution.
